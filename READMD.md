#The smart car is a highly computerized automobile featuring ubiquitous computing,
 intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform. 
Here, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a 
transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate 
a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. 
Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of 
car-appropriate applications according to their wants and needs.
